## Brief Introduction
Hello, My name is Shon and this is my individual website for the stepper motor subsystem. I use SPI to communicate over a daisy chain network to recieve and send values over UART. My system has four main components: The Stepper Motor, Motor Driver, PIC Micontroller, and the 3.3V Switching Regulator. The goal of the motor subsystem is to rotate the solar panel based off the message it recieves from the daisy chain network. In return, it will rotate the solar panel based on the direction of the sun so the panel can produce energy at its peak.
