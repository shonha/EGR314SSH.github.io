## Brief Introduction
Hello, My name is Shon and this is my individual website for the stepper motor subsystem. I use SPI to communicate over a daisy chain network to recieve and send values over UART. My system has four main components: The Stepper Motor, Motor Driver, PIC Micontroller, and the 3.3V Switching Regulator.
