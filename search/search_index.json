I use SPI to communicate over a daisy chain network to recieve and send values over UART. My system has four main components: The Stepper Motor, Motor Driver, PIC Micontroller, and the 3.3V Switching Regulator. The goal of the motor subsystem is to rotate the solar panel based off the message it recieves from the daisy chain network. In return, it will rotate the solar panel based on the direction of the sun so the panel can produce energy at its peak.</p>"},{"location":"#milestones","title":"Milestones","text":"Assignments Dates Block Diagram 1/31 Component Selection &amp; PIC Table 2/7 Schematic Design 2/21 Power Budget 2/21 External Design Review 2/24 BOM &amp; Hardware Orders 2/28 Individual API Documentation 3/28 Subsystem PCB Design 4/4 Subsystem Hardware Verification 4/11 Software Implementation 4/23 Innovation Showcase 5/2 <p>Team Website</p>"},{"location":"API/","title":"API","text":""},{"location":"API/#team-bytes","title":"Team Bytes","text":"Byte Function AZ Start YB Stop Unique ID Byte Shon Ha h Maximus Mathews m Rohan Fernandez f Shelton Larance l"},{"location":"API/#messages-sent","title":"Messages Sent","text":""},{"location":"API/#message-type-2-light-readings-from-optical-sensor","title":"Message Type 2 (Light Readings from Optical Sensor)","text":"<p>Received and Forwarded to MQTT</p> Byte 1-2 Byte 3-6 Byte 7-8 Byte 9-12 Variable Name sensor_one L1_Reading sensor_two L2_Reading Variable Type char char char char Min Value S1 0000 S2 0000 Max Value S1 9999 S2 9999 Example S1 3567 S2 2343"},{"location":"API/#messages-received","title":"Messages Received","text":""},{"location":"API/#message-type-1-wifi-toggle-automanual","title":"Message Type 1 (Wifi Toggle - Auto/Manual)","text":"<p>Used to toggle stepper motor functionality from automatic (state 0) to manual (state 1).</p> Byte 1 Byte 2 Variable Name mode mode_toggle Variable Type char char Min Value M 0 Max Value M 1 Example M 1"},{"location":"API/#message-type-2-optical-sensor-readings","title":"Message Type 2 (Optical Sensor Readings)","text":"<p>Used to determine where the stepper motor will rotate, facing the solar panel towards the highest light level detected by the optical sensors.

I use a 3.3V Switching regulator to power my PIC along with a bidirectional connection to a MPLAB Snap Programmer to program my microcontroller. As depicted in the block diagram, it includes how pins are layed out and connection to my microcontroller along with where power can be received from.

My PIC choice was also inspired by the one used in class as it features the same program memory size and ram size as the DIP given in class. Both the motor driver and motor on the other hand was chosen due to their affordability while also having to heavily rely on their datasheets. This allowed me to meet my product requirements as I utilize a PIC microcontroller, a 3.3V switching regulator, SPI motor driver, and a stepper motor.
